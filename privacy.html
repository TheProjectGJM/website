                <p>This Policy describes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What personal data we collect from you.</li>
                    <li>How and why we collect it.</li>

                <h2>3. WHAT DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY</h2>

                <h3>3.1 ACCOUNT AND IDENTITY DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email address (when signing up with email/password).</li>
                    <li>Display name / username (optional, set by the user).</li>
                    <li>Google account name and profile picture (if using Google Sign-In).</li>
                    <li>Firebase User UID (unique identifier assigned automatically).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create and manage your account, authenticate you, and personalise your
                    experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract.</p>

                <h3>3.2 USER PREFERENCES AND QUESTIONNAIRE DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interests selected during the onboarding questionnaire (e.g., Museums, Parks, Restaurants, Art,
                        etc.).</li>
                    <li>Questionnaire completion timestamp.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To personalise AI-generated recommendations and map content.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract; Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR –
                    consent (where obtained explicitly).</p>

                <h3>3.3 PRECISE LOCATION DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>GPS latitude and longitude, updated in real time during active sessions.</li>
                    <li>Location timestamps sent to the server every ~10 seconds while the Live AI audio feature is
                        active.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide location-aware AI responses, display relevant map markers, plan
                    trips, and surface nearby points of interest.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR – explicit consent via OS permission prompt.
                    Users may revoke this permission at any time in device settings.</p>
                <p><strong>US Note:</strong> Location data is considered sensitive under several state laws (see Section
                    10). We do not sell precise location data.</p>
                <p><strong>Canada Note:</strong> Location data is collected only with meaningful consent and is not used
                    for profiling beyond the stated purpose.</p>

                <h3>3.4 AUDIO DATA (MICROPHONE)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time audio captured from the device microphone during active Live AI sessions.</li>
                    <li>Audio is streamed via encrypted WebSocket to our server for processing.</li>
                    <li>Raw audio is NOT retained by our server after processing. Audio bytes streamed through the
                        WebSocket endpoints are forwarded in real time to the speech-to-text provider (AssemblyAI) and
                        immediately discarded. We do not store, archive, or use raw audio for model training.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable real-time, voice-activated AI assistance and to return
                    contextualised spoken responses.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR – explicit consent via OS permission prompt.
                    Audio capture only starts when the user actively initiates a session.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We request microphone permission only when the Live AI feature is first
                    used. The microphone is deactivated as soon as the session ends.</p>

                <h3>3.5 DEVICE AND TECHNICAL DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device operating system and version (iOS / Android).</li>
                    <li>Anonymous device identifiers used by Firebase and RevenueCat.</li>
                    <li>App version and build number.</li>
                    <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics (Firebase Crashlytics / RevenueCat).</li>
                    <li>IP address (collected by our servers and third-party services on each request).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To maintain app stability, debug issues, and improve performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR – legitimate interests.</p>

                <h3>3.6 SUBSCRIPTION AND PAYMENT DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subscription status (free / pro).</li>
                    <li>Purchase history and entitlement records managed by RevenueCat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Payment card details are NOT collected or stored by us. All payment processing
                    is handled exclusively by Apple App Store / Google Play. We only receive anonymised transaction
                    references and entitlement status.</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To gate premium features and manage subscriptions.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract.</p>

                <h3>3.7 USAGE AND INTERACTION DATA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chat messages sent to the AI (text prompts, voice transcripts).</li>
                    <li>Points of interest browsed and interactions with map markers.</li>
                    <li>Trip planning queries and saved trips.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Server-side conversation state:</strong> During an active WebSocket session the server
                    maintains an in-memory conversation history (up to the last 10 turns) to provide context to the AI
                    model. This in-memory history is destroyed when the session ends and is never written to disk or any
                    database on our side. We do NOT use conversation content to train or fine-tune AI models. Daily
                    per-user AI cost is accumulated in Firestore (field: usage.cost_usd) solely for quota enforcement
                    and is not linked to message content.</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To deliver AI responses, maintain conversation continuity, and improve the
                    service.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Basis (EU):</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract; Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR –
                    consent where required.</p>

                <h3>3.8 SOCIAL SHARING DATA</h3>
                <p>When using the "Share to Instagram Stories" feature, a generated image is created on-device and
                    shared through the Instagram app. No content is transmitted to us in this process.</p>

                <p>The App uses AI and machine learning to generate personalised recommendations, audio responses, and
                    trip suggestions. These are not purely automated decisions with "significant" legal or similarly
                    significant effects as defined under GDPR Art. 22, as they serve as informational assistance only
                    and require your active engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>Server-side AI processing:</strong> The backend uses Google Gemini models (gemini-2.5-flash
                    and gemini-2.5-flash-lite) to generate responses for the "Goomby" (navigation & general assistant)
                    and "Trip Planner" features. AI outputs serve solely as informational suggestions; the user always
                    retains full control over their actions. Per-user daily cost tracking is used exclusively to enforce
                    usage quotas and does not constitute profiling.</p>

                <h2>17. BACKEND SERVER PROCESSING</h2>

                <h3>17.1 HOSTING AND INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
                <p>The backend API is a containerised Python / FastAPI application deployed on Google Cloud Run. Cloud
                    Run automatically provisions managed infrastructure; the physical data-centre region is configurable
                    and is set to the region closest to our primary user base (EU/US). All network traffic between the
                    App and the server is encrypted with TLS 1.2 or higher, including WebSocket connections (WSS).</p>

                <h3>17.2 API ENDPOINTS AND DATA HANDLING</h3>
                <p>The server exposes the following endpoints. Each endpoint requires two authentication headers on
                    every request:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>x-api-key:</strong> validated against a server-side secret.</li>
                    <li><strong>x-user-uuid:</strong> validated against an existing Firebase Firestore user record. The
                        UUID is used only for quota enforcement (see 17.4).</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="endpoint-details">
                    <p><strong>GET /export/</strong><br>
                        Returns points of interest from a read-only internal SQLite database (cities.db). No personal
                        data is collected or stored. Accepts an optional city_id query parameter to filter results.</p>

                    <p><strong>POST /query/</strong><br>
                        Accepts a JSON payload containing conversation history (text messages), user GPS coordinates,
                        and an assistant name ("goomby" or "trip-planner"). The message history and location are
                        forwarded to Google Gemini for inference. AI cost is calculated and added to the user's daily
                        spending record in Firestore (cost_usd only — no message content is persisted). No conversation
                        messages are stored server-side after the request completes.</p>

                    <p><strong>POST /plan/</strong><br>
                        Accepts a trip-planning request (destination, dates, interests, special needs). The parameters
                        are forwarded to Google Gemini to generate a day-by-day itinerary. No personal data beyond the
                        request parameters is retained after the response is returned.</p>

                    <p><strong>POST /comment/</strong><br>
                        Accepts user feedback (sender identifier, comment text, timestamp). Forwards the comment to an
                        internal Slack channel for review. Comment content is transmitted to Slack (a Salesforce Inc.
                        service) and is subject to Slack's privacy policy. We do not store comment content in our own
                        databases.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>17.3 WEBSOCKET ENDPOINTS AND AUDIO PROCESSING</h3>
                <p>The server operates three WebSocket endpoints for real-time voice sessions:</p>

                <div class="endpoint-details">
                    <p><strong>/stream (Gemini Native Audio)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raw PCM audio (16 kHz, 16-bit mono) is received from the App and forwarded directly to the
                            Google Gemini Live API, which performs speech recognition, AI inference, and audio synthesis
                            natively.</li>
                        <li>GPS coordinates sent as JSON text frames are held in server memory for the session duration
                            to contextualise AI responses and support walking navigation (start_route, get_route_info,
                            get_next_steps).</li>
                        <li>No audio data is written to disk or any database.</li>
                        <li>Route milestone notifications are generated and injected into the Gemini session as system
                            events; no personal data is stored.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>/mystream (AssemblyAI STT + Gemini LLM + ElevenLabs/gTTS TTS)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raw PCM audio is streamed in real time to AssemblyAI for speech-to-text transcription.
                            AssemblyAI processes audio under its own privacy policy and, by agreement, does not retain
                            audio beyond the transcription session.</li>
                        <li>The resulting transcript text is forwarded to Google Gemini for LLM inference. The AI
                            response text is then converted to speech via ElevenLabs, Kokoro-82M (via DeepInfra), or
                            gTTS, and the resulting PCM audio is streamed back to the App.</li>
                        <li>An in-memory conversation history (last 10 turns of text) is maintained for the duration of
                            the session to provide context. It is destroyed on disconnect and is never written to disk
                            or a database.</li>
                        <li>GPS coordinate updates are held in server memory for navigation context only and discarded
                            on session end.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>/easystream (Gemini LLM via REST + gTTS/ElevenLabs/Kokoro TTS)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A client-side energy-based Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the server side determines
                            utterance boundaries. Detected utterances are converted to WAV and sent to Google Gemini's
                            REST generate_content API for inference.</li>
                        <li>TTS follows the same pipeline as /mystream.</li>
                        <li>An in-memory rolling history (last 10 turns) is held for session context only. GPS location
                            updates are handled as in /mystream.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>17.4 USAGE QUOTA AND FIRESTORE DATA</h3>
                <p>For every authenticated request that incurs an AI inference cost, the server writes or updates a
                    single usage field on the user's Firestore document:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>users/{user_uuid}.usage = {
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",   (in Europe/Madrid timezone)
  "cost_usd": &lt;float&gt;
}</pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only the cumulative daily cost figure and the date are stored.</li>
                    <li>No message content, audio, or location history is written to Firestore.</li>
                    <li>The cost figure is reset to zero at the start of each new calendar day (Spain time).</li>
                    <li>If the daily quota (configurable per deployment) is reached, subsequent requests from that user
                        return HTTP 429 until the quota resets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>17.5 LOG RETENTION</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Cloud Run captures stdout/stderr from the server process. These logs may contain the
                        x-user-uuid header value (for debugging), error stack traces, and AI usage cost summaries. They
                        do NOT contain raw audio data or full conversation transcripts.</li>
                    <li>Cloud Run log retention: 30 days (Google Cloud Logging default).</li>
                    <li>Access logs (HTTP request metadata including IP address and endpoint path) are retained by
                        Google Cloud for 30 days.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>17.6 ABUSE PREVENTION AND RATE LIMITING</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Per-user daily spending quotas are enforced at the application layer (HTTP 429 response when
                        quota is exceeded).</li>
                    <li>All requests require a valid API key and a registered user UUID; unauthenticated requests are
                        rejected immediately (HTTP 401).</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure-level DDoS protection is provided by Google Cloud Run's managed networking layer.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>17.7 PERSONAL DATA USE FOR AI TRAINING</h3>
                <p>We do NOT use any personal data processed through our server (including voice audio, conversation
                    transcripts, or location history) to train, fine-tune, or evaluate any AI model. Data forwarded to
                    third-party AI providers (Google Gemini, AssemblyAI, ElevenLabs, DeepInfra) is governed by those
                    providers' data-use and training policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those
                    providers for details.</p>

                <h3>17.8 BACKUP AND DISASTER RECOVERY</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firestore data (user account records and usage quota fields) benefits from Google Cloud's
                        built-in multi-region replication and automated daily backups with a 7-day retention window
                        (default GCP settings).</li>
                    <li>The cities.db SQLite database is read-only content bundled with the container image. It does not
                        contain personal data.</li>
                    <li>No additional backup mechanism is operated by us for session-scoped data, as none of it is
                        persisted beyond the session.</li>
